## what is Hacktoberfest?
**Hacktoberfest** is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and Twilio. Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!

## Why Should I Contribute?

The Hacktoberfest‚Äôs simple plain objective is:
Support open source and earn a limited edition T-shirt!
in this fest you you can gain knowledge how to create a pull request effectively.
But, it‚Äôs not just about the t-shirts or stickers. Its about supporting open source. Its about celebrating open source, and giving it back. If you‚Äôve never contributed to open source before, this is the perfect time to get started because Hacktoberfest provides a large list of available contribution opportunities.

## What Can I Contribute?

Hacktoberfest¬Æ is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you‚Äôre a developer, student learning to code. You can contribute to anything from code to simple fix, new feature to grammar mistake. This motivates even a beginner to be a part of open source contributions.

## Event details:
Hacktoberfest¬Æ is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you‚Äôre a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community.
